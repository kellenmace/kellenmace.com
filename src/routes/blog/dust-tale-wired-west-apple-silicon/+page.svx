I have fond memories of playing [Dust: A Tale of the Wired West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust:_A_Tale_of_the_Wired_West) with one of my best friends growing up. It's a great game!

You can follow the steps below to play Dust on an Apple Silicon ARM-based Mac using [DOSBox Game Launcher](https://dbgl.org/).

1. Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
1. Run `java --version` on the command line to see if you have Java installed.
1. If you do not have Java installed, run `brew install --cask temurin` to install the [Eclipse Temurin Java Development Kit](https://adoptium.net/). Run `java --version` again to confirm that installation was successful. If it was, an OpenJDK version number will be printed on the command line.
1. Download and install the macOS ARM version of [DOSBox Game Launcher](https://dbgl.org/) from their website.
1. Download the game archive [dust.dbgl.zip](https://www.danielhobi.ch/dust/dust.dbgl.zip) without extracting it.
1. Open the DOSBox Game Launcher app (the `DBGL` app in your `Applications` folder).
1. In the top menu bar, go to `Profiles` > `Import` and select the `dust.dbgl.zip` file.
1. Keep pressing the `Next` button on each screen to accept the defaults and proceed with the import. As of November, 2024, I experienced a bug in DOSBox Game Launcher where the row of `Previous`, `Next` and `Cancel` buttons at the bottom of these screens were not visible. I had to hit `tab` repeatedly in order for them to be highlighted with an outline so I could tell where they are and click them. You can search for "DOSBox game launcher" on YouTube to find a video of someone else importing games so you can see the positioning of each of them and tell which is which.
1. When the installation finishes, you should be able to click `Run Profile` to boot up the game.
1. Enjoy! ðŸ¤ 


## A note on not being able to see the games list
As of November, 2024, I experienced another bug preventing me from being able to see the games list- everything just appeared gray. If you experience the same thing and Dust is the only game you have imported, I think you'll be able to just click `Run profile` and it will boot up your one and only game.

If you have the invisible games list problem and multiple games loaded into DOSBox Game Launcher though, I found that you can hover your mouse cursor over the invisible rows of the games list under where the `Run profile` icon is, pausing at various points until you see a tooltip that says "Cyberflix Incorporated". When you see that tooltip, click the left mouse button to select the game, then click `Run profile` to launch it. Clearly, that's a super hacky workaround, but at least you'll be able to play the game!


## Resources
The list of keyboard shortcuts for DOSBox is here:
[https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Special_Keys](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Special_Keys)

To use the F- keys on macOS, you need to hold down the `fn` key.


## Thanks
Some of the steps in this guide and the linked zip file are from this page on Daniel Hobi's site:

It looks like he also has [game packs and instructions](https://www.danielhobi.ch/taoot/) for running Cyberflix's Titanic game, if you want to play that, too.
